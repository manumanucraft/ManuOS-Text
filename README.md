ManuOS-Text
===========

ComputerCraft 1.65 OS with MIT license. See all the branches for each version.

Development Branch
==================
This branch is ALWAYS the last version. I don't recommend you to use this: It aren't finished and it's possible than it can't wrap the files.

Alpha Branch
============
This branch is the newest "final" version. It can't be tested yet. If it's tested, it's only by the creators.

Beta Branch
===========
This branch are debugged by creators and by the people. Bugs are fixed by the issues in Alpha Branch.
